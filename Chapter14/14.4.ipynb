    "## Linear Approximations\n",
    "The linear function whose graph is the tangent plane of $z=f(x,y)$ at the point $(x,y,f(x,y))$; that is\n",

    "L(x,y) = f(a,b) +f_x(a,b)(x-a)+f_y(a,b)(y-b)\n",

    "1. Find the linear approximation of the function \n",

    "## Differentials\n",
    "For a differentiable function of two variables, $z = f (x, y)$, \n",

    "### Example\n",
    "1. If $z = f (x, y) = x^22 + 3xy – y^2$, find the differential $dz$.\n",
    "2. If $x$ changes from $2$ to $2.05$ and $y$ changes from $3$ to \t$2.96$, compare the values of $\\Delta z$ and $dz$.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "The dimensions of a rectangular box are measured to be $75$ cm, $60$ cm, and $40$ cm, and each measurement is correct to within $0.2$ cm. Use differentials to estimate the largest possible error when the volume of the box is calculated from these measurements.\n"
